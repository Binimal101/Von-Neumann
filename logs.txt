PEPSI MAN#9704: Hello von you dumas
Stifled#3615: <@!350775477255929856> need to get your opinion on smth
Stifled#3615: I stopped advertsising the server while we finish getting some things set up
Stifled#3615: just for a bit
Stifled#3615: When people join, I want them to react to a message which will promote them to a rank of their choice.
Franne#7261: okay
Franne#7261: like reaction roles i asume
Franne#7261: ?
Stifled#3615: yeah
Stifled#3615: then I want to basically host events for each category
Stifled#3615: so for example, people new to coding will have a role called 'learner'.

Aly#6510: lmao
Stifled#3615: hiiiiiiiiii
Stifled#3615: i came to c what depressing as song u were playing this time then saw NF and i like themn
Franne#7261: von eval "#
PEPSI MAN#9704: Ima be free to vc in a min
PythonicFreakshow#4818: I applaud your grammar
PEPSI MAN#9704: And excuse me but whats wrong w NF
PythonicFreakshow#4818: ^
PEPSI MAN#9704: What
PEPSI MAN#9704: Hi von
PEPSI MAN#9704: Hi von
PEPSI MAN#9704: Hi von
PEPSI MAN#9704: Hi von
PEPSI MAN#9704: Bye von
PythonicFreakshow#4818: Stop, thats nota funny
Franne#7261: i'm sorry
PythonicFreakshow#4818: All good lmfao
Franne#7261: how did you implement the eval function?
PythonicFreakshow#4818: eval()
PythonicFreakshow#4818: 👀
Franne#7261: yeah but i mean how do you send the arguments from the message
PythonicFreakshow#4818: thru string form
PythonicFreakshow#4818: had to splice the message tho
PythonicFreakshow#4818: ```py
connection= client.get_channel(channel_dictionary["bot_commands"])    
equation = unpack_math(message.content)
await connection.send(f"{equation} = {eval(equation)}")
```
PythonicFreakshow#4818: ill send the function too
Franne#7261: okay i see
Franne#7261: yeah i was interested in seeing if the string was just directly concatenated in some way
Franne#7261: probably python handles this already (i dont really know) but in java for example is dangerous to just concat strings using + and its advised to use a StringBuilder to avoid arbitrary execution
PythonicFreakshow#4818: ```py
def unpack_math(message):
    equation = ""
    look_for = "1234567890+-/*^.()"
    for char in message:
        equation = equation + (char if char in look_for else "")
    return equation
```
PythonicFreakshow#4818: Python prolly does that but I think its definitely possible to screw stuff up with eval() and exec() if you don't know what your doing
PythonicFreakshow#4818: in which I don't
Stifled#3615: pepi when redy cawl mw
PythonicFreakshow#4818: pepi man
PythonicFreakshow#4818: mepi pan
PythonicFreakshow#4818: btw <@!435339456505970689> I'ma just get angry rq
PythonicFreakshow#4818: So when you call the @client.event for get_raw_reaction_add(payload)
PythonicFreakshow#4818: and you call payload.emoji
PythonicFreakshow#4818: it returns not the emoji class
PythonicFreakshow#4818: but a varient of it to where you cannot get the id
PythonicFreakshow#4818: so here I am hashing it with sha256 to compare it to itself since discord's hash function only works in the same runtime to compare two things, which is gay
Franne#7261: yeah i'm guessing you should be fine with that impl and the discord api probably managing code injection already but eval and the like are delicate functions so keep an eye on those lol
Stifled#3615: Oh Beaver Dam
Stifled#3615: that's my new cuss word equivelent
Stifled#3615: let me find on youtube a work around
PythonicFreakshow#4818: I should block it with von
that'd be a funny
PythonicFreakshow#4818: It works
PythonicFreakshow#4818: no need
Stifled#3615: NICE
PythonicFreakshow#4818: just stupid as hell
PythonicFreakshow#4818: not the role part yet
PythonicFreakshow#4818: just recognises that you react to a certain reaction, on a certain message
PythonicFreakshow#4818: so far I have yet to get it to see who reacted nor get the member object and give them the specified role
PythonicFreakshow#4818: nor reset the emoji
PythonicFreakshow#4818: cause button pog
PythonicFreakshow#4818: will do
Aly#6510: guys help im turning into a zodiac freak
PEPSI MAN#9704: Why
PEPSI MAN#9704: <@435339456505970689> ill be on in 5
Franne#7261: imma ask does anyone have any good looking wallpapers they can share?
Franne#7261: i always struggle finding quality ones
Aly#6510: What kind you want
PEPSI MAN#9704: Im on the call
PEPSI MAN#9704: This is aly's specialty
PEPSI MAN#9704: Finding images, emojis and stuff
Franne#7261: i like simple colorful ones, that let desktop icons be seen with ease
PEPSI MAN#9704: J like a colourfuk pattern?
Franne#7261: yeah like, you know when you get a new phone out of the box, and they usually come with some fresh simple wallpaper
Aly#6510: do you have dimensions?
Franne#7261: 1366x768 is my laptop's but anything 1080 will do
PEPSI MAN#9704: Yeah that helps

PythonicFreakshow#4818: no it doesn't even send
PythonicFreakshow#4818: hm thats wonky
PythonicFreakshow#4818: it does throw an err on vons side when I dm ppl like that but ill just use a try except block

kevin de bruin#9359: Ohhh my moms router
PythonicFreakshow#4818: oop
Stifled#3615: Not bad but you know using Kali is like    Heating  frozen pizza and saying you made the dough yourself
kevin de bruin#9359: Yeah ik
PythonicFreakshow#4818: but then again if its that easy it should be more mainstream
Stifled#3615: Most people just use the tools not much is actually being done 😦
PythonicFreakshow#4818: oh god both of u are typing

Stifled#3615: You should download Metasploitable3
Stifled#3615: It’s great to practice hacking
Stifled#3615: It’s a server you@run on tour own pc
Stifled#3615: And after hacking it you@list search for these cards
Stifled#3615: But it’s really good to use to practice wireless attacks etc
PythonicFreakshow#4818: .

Stifled#3615: To <@&838658069771583518>! We have discovered a few bugs revolving around the permissions of the server. Common complainants where:

Inability to see the <#828876919936253952>.
Inability to see message history on specific channels. 
Some roles couldn't write messages in specific channels. 

We will have another maintenance period to address these issues soon, thanks!

PythonicFreakshow#4818: good morning
Stifled#3615: good morning
Stifled#3615: To @everyone! On the 26th of June, Covenzis is hosting a global conference about the future of healthcare. The link is https://www.convenzis.co.uk/events/adapting-and-innovating-the-future-of-healthcare-international-summit/. In the conference, they will go over the implementation of medical robots in modern healthcare systems. They will also be going over technology in general. It is targeted at **pre-u students and above ONLY** so anybody below this requirement should not attend. It is completely free but requires you to book a place in order to attend. For those who are considering biomedical engineering, or any other engineering and medical related field, I encourage you to join. Lastly, <@&838653635109322802> players, we have the server blacklisted at the moment. We have builders still uploading schematics of their creations and they are taking longer than expected. Once you all join and are settled, I will open the server to the public to start raising funds for ME. Thanks!
Stifled#3615: hi von
Stifled#3615: <@!765972771418275841>
PythonicFreakshow#4818: hm yes
PythonicFreakshow#4818: thats me
Stifled#3615: ive been off discord for a while cause i must study
Stifled#3615: but
Stifled#3615: I just had a look at the react roles
Stifled#3615: very good job
PythonicFreakshow#4818: Thank you
PythonicFreakshow#4818: and I have a bone to pick with you 😤
PythonicFreakshow#4818: you changed the names of the roles
Stifled#3615: super cool how Von messages you saying u have either added or rewmoved role
PythonicFreakshow#4818: and broke the bot
Stifled#3615: HAHAH
PythonicFreakshow#4818: why
Stifled#3615: I made the roles all lowercase
PythonicFreakshow#4818: it was literally only capitalization
Stifled#3615: yeah
Stifled#3615: AHHA
Stifled#3615: I have OCD and some of the roles were capitals and some werent
Stifled#3615: that pissed me off
PythonicFreakshow#4818: the way it works is by cycling thru and comparing the string representation of both the role name and emoji name, and if those are equal then the role is given
PythonicFreakshow#4818: if u want change the others to capitals, or go into emoji's change those to lower and the roles to lower
PythonicFreakshow#4818: but the emoji name needs to be the exact same as the role
PythonicFreakshow#4818: case sensitive
Stifled#3615: on
